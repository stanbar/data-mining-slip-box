The binomial random graph $G(n,p)$  is generated by starting with $[n] = {1,2,...,n}$ nodes and then for each pair of nodes $i, j$ we independently add an edge $ij$ in G with probability $p$.

There are ${N}\choose{m}$ labelled graphs on $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, where $N = {n}\choose{m}$ is the number of pair of nodes.

Probability of achieving particular graph $G$ is 
$$\mathbb{P}(G) = p^m(1-p)^{N-m}$$.

So $G(n,p)$ is formally defined as the propability destribution over a family of labelled graphs on *n* nodes.

In particular, chance of generating a complete graph $K_n$ and empty graph $\overline{K_n}$  are exactly the same for $G(n, \frac{1}{2})$. 

We say that an [[Event]] in a given [[Probability space]] holds [[Asymptotically almost surely]] (a.a.s.), if its probability tends to one as $n$ goes to infinity. For example, a.a.s. G(n, \frac{1}{2}) is not the complete graph $K_n$ nor the empty graph $\overline{K_n}$.
