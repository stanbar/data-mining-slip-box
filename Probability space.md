Probability space is an mathematical construct that provides a formal model of a random process. For example we can define a probability space of throwing a dice.

Probability space or probability triple consist of $(\omega, F, P)$, where 
- A sample space $\omega$ is the set of all possible outcomes.
- An event space $F$ is a set of [[Event]]s.
- A probability function, which assigns each event in the event space a probability, which is a number between $0$ and $1$.
