An event is a set of possible outcomes of an experiment (a subset of the sample space) to which the probability is assigned.

If we assemble a deck of 52 playing cards, and draw a single card then:
- the sample space is a 52-element set (all cards).
- an event, is however any subset of the sample space, the so-called *power set*, including any singleton set, empty set with probability zero, and sample space itself (a certain event with probability one).

potential events are:
- "Red and Black at the same time without being a joker" (0 elements)
- "The 5 of Hearts" (1 element), chance $\frac{1}{52}$.
- "A king" (4 elements), chance $\frac{4}{52}$
- "A face card" (12 elements), chance $\frac{12}{52}$.


If the chance of each outcome is equal, the probability $P$ of an event $A$ is the following formula:
$\Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$,  where $|A|$ is the size of event $A$ (number of elements), and $\Omega$ is the size of sample set.
