Degree of a node $v \in V$ is $deg(v) = \sum_{u \in V} a(u,v)$, where $a(u,v)$  is the weight of the edge betwen $v$ and $u \in V$.

For unweighted graphs $deg(n) = |N(v)| = \textrm{\# neighbours of v}$.

The degree sequence is $d = (deg(v_1),..., deg(v_n))$ 

with non-decreasing order i.e. $deg(v_1) \leq deg(v_2) \leq ... \leq deg(v_n))$.

The degree distribution $d_l$ is the fraction of nodes with degree $l$,
