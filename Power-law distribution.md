Real-world networks typically do not have Poisson distribution, they usually follows power law:

$d_l \approx c * l^{-y}$

for some parameter $y > 0$ (degree exponent) and normalizing constant $c > 0$.

This phenomena was first observed by Vilfredo Pareto, who observed that a few wealthy individuals posses the majority of world wealth.

The power-low can be recognized by plotting degree distribution in logarothmic scale, which becomes a linear function with the slope $-y$.

Which can be observed by:
$$d_l = c * l^{-y}$$
$$\ln d_l = -y \ln l + \ln c$$.
