Poisson (/puason/) distribution is a probability distribution that is used to show how many times an event is likely to occur in a given peroidâ€”it is a count distribution. Poisson distributions are often used to understand independednt events that occur at a constant rate within a given interval of time.

Poisson distribution is a discrete function, meaning that the variable can only take specific values from (possibly infinite) set of possibilities.

Poisson distribution can be used to estimate how likely it is that an event will happen *x* number of times within a period of time.

The formula for the poisson distribution is:
$$f(x) = \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}e^{-\lambda}$$

Where:
- x is the number of of occurences
- $\lambda$ is the expected value (EV) [[Degree Sequence#Moment of the degree]].
