An [[Event]] happens asymptotically almost surely if the probability converages to one.

For example
- in number theory, a large number is a.a.s. composite, by the prime number theorem.
- in graph theory, a probability that graph $G(n,p_n)$ is connected is a.a.s. when for some $\epsilon >0$, $p_n > \frac{(1+\epsilon)\ln n}{n}$
